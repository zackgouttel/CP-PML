## Practical Machine Learning Course on Coursera (R Specialization)

This Repository highlights my submission for the final project on the Practical Machine Learning course, included within the R Specialization on Coursera, provided by John Hopkins University.

In this repository, I prepared data collected using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit about personal activity.
 
People collected this data order to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. 
However, our goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants that were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

The output will be a ML model that allows to predict whether the barbell lifts were correct or not, based on the data from the wearables.

Check it out by cloning and opening this project on RStudio (or any other R Markdown supporting IDE) !
